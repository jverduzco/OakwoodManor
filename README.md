Missouri Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support



Introduction



The overarching themes across the MO SW-PBS Handbook and the Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Im- plementation Guides include:

Culturally Responsive Sys- tems, Data and Practices

Prevention and Early Inter- vention

Function Based Thinking

Continuum of Support

Systems Change



It is important to note that the foundations that your team establishes and sustains at Tier 1 are the components that your schoolwide community will target, intensify and individu- alize as you begin to establish and sustain Tiers 2 and 3 of your tiered system of support for behavior.



Welcome to the Missouri Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support (MO SW-PBS) Tier 1 Implementation Guide (IG). This document is the how-to for implementation of Tier 1 Systems, Data and Practices with fidelity, consistency and equity. The materials included in this Imple- mentation Guide are intended to guide schools to create their own social behavioral system for universal support.



Research, as well as practical application in schools across Missouri, and the nation, demonstrates that when schoolwide communities collaborate around and implement the Essential Components of SW- PBS with fidelity, consistency and equity shared outcome goals such as improved student behavior, attendance and academic outcomes are achieved (Bradshaw, Mitchell, & Leaf, 2010; Freeman, Simonsen, McCoach, Sugai, Lombardi, & Horner, 2016). Improved organizational health (e.g., schoolwide climate, resources influence and staff affilia- tion) is also reported (Bradshaw, Koth, Bevans, Ialongo, & Leaf, 2008).



SW-PBS is an organizational framework. As a framework, it is not a specific “model” or “program.” Rather, SW-PBS is a compilation of ev- idence-based practices, interventions, and systems change strategies that schools can customize to meet the needs of their school culture. To embrace prevention logic and function-based thinking, Missouri has identified features or components of Tier 1 implementation from the PBIS National Center Implementer’s Blueprint that form a highly

effective approach to schoolwide discipline (OSEP, 2015). Each Essen- tial Component is vital. They operate together to ensure a positive and proactive approach to discipline that is likely to lead to behavioral and academic success. These components include: 1) Common Philosophy

                                                          and Purpose, 2) Leadership, 3) Clarifying Expected Behavior, 4) Teach-

ing Expected Behavior, 5) Encouraging Expected Behavior, 6) Discour-

Schoolwide Positive Behavior

Support (SW-PBS) is also known as Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) or Effective Behavioral Supports (EBS)



Key Terms



Fidelity means implementing as an

intervention was designed.



Consistency means all day, every day, all year long.



Equity means all stakeholders, at equal levels of fidelity and intensity, all day, every day.

aging Unexpected Behavior, 7) Ongoing Monitoring, and 8) Profession- al Learning.



The Essential Components in general, and teaching specifically, must be implemented with fidelity, meaning as designed; with consisten- cy, meaning all day, every day, all year long; and with equity, meaning with all stakeholders, at equal levels of fidelity and intensity, all day, every day, in order to verify that universal prevention is indeed, in place. Without this precise level of implementation, the desired outcomes can not be realized in general, or for specific sub-groups of students in particular.



Many schools find it challenging to meet the social and emotional sup- port needs of students from different cultural backgrounds, indicating the importance of a focus on educational practices that allow all stu- dents to experience equitable outcomes (Vincent et al, 2011). When your team begins work on establishing and then sustaining Tier 1 systems, data and practices you are charged with creating schoolwide environ- ments where all members of the community belong and are valued.



Creating the clear connection between the theories supporting SW- PBS and Culturally Responsive Practices can help all members of the school community understand and foster a supportive climate.



Connecting SW-PBS and Culturally Responsive Practices



SW-PBS

Culturally Responsive Practices

a level playing field, where all students, regardless of their back- grounds, can be held to the same behavioral standards (Horner, Sugai, Lewis-Palmer, & Todd, 2001)

Human behavior is lawful and affected by the environment (Sugai et al., 2010)

Changing the environment chang- es student behavior (Sugai & Horner, 2002)

A school culture where all students share a common language and common knowledge of appropri- ate (expected) and inappropriate (unexpected) behaviors creates

The laws of human behavior are moderated by complex cultural con- texts (Bandura, 2002)

Multiple and often culturally diver- gent environments affect behavior (Delpit, 1992; Noguera, 2003)

School cultures are intended to be environments where differences among students are a source of en- richment for all (Monroe, 2005, 2009).

(Vincent, Randall, Cartledge, Tobin, & Swain-Bradway, 2011)



Both SW-PBS and Culturally Responsive Practices are centered around the interaction of the individual and their environment, with consideration of learning history and culture. Individual learning his- tory can include previous experiences in and out of school, includ- ing academic successes and struggles, social interactions, positive and adverse childhood experiences, illness or injury, and access to having basic needs met. As indicated in the table above, culture is a mitigating factor or influence on the individual’s learning history and daily experience. Race, ethnicity, language, gender, gender identity, faith and religion, sexual orientation are examples of cultural influ- ences, as well as socioeconomic status, geography (urban, rural, suburban), and ability.



It is critical for the district and school to consider all members of the community, and work to ensure all are represented, heard, and val- ued in the development of schoolwide systems, data, and practices. All members of the school community should feel a sense of be- longing. When working toward equitable outcomes for all students, it is necessary for all students, families, and community members to feel welcome in the school.



For more information on Culturally Responsive Practices see the MO SW-PBS Handbook, A Systems Approach.



Key Terms



Cultural Equity – The quality of being fair or impartial so all educational Opportunities are inclusive

and diverse but not necessari- ly equal for all.



Cultural Validity – Ensuring data measures are culturally sound.



Cultural Relevance – What is taught and how it is taught are pertinent to cultures rep- resented in your school and community.



Cultural Knowledge – Educa- tion about cultures represent- ed in your school and aware- ness of one’s own culture.



Resources Available from MO SW-PBS



Missouri SW-PBS has developed an entire curriculum to provide foundational knowledge and implementation assistance. This cur- riculum is designed to provide research, content knowledge, exam- ples, practice activities, and resources to guide your school in the initial development and regular revision of materials needed for your school’s implementation. Although the primary audience of the MO SW-PBS training curriculum is Building Leadership Teams (BLT) that have a focus on student behavior to guide them in preparation, im- plementation, and maintenance of MO SW-PBS in their school, the resources available will also provide benefit to collaborative grade level or departmental teams and / or individual educators working to grow their knowledge and skills. These materials are publicly available at the MO SW-PBS website at pbismissouri.org and can be accessed by

educators for individual study

all staff as they participate in professional learning training sessions

school SW-PBS coaches who provide support to individual educators to improve implementation

parents and family members

students

district level personnel

interested community members

Team Activities are provided to give direction to your team to build your SW-PBS system, data and practices.

Stakeholder Engagement and Communication suggestions are given to ensure students, fami- lies, staff and community members are represented, heard, and valued.

Action Planning - activities that your team will need to engage in to prepare to implement Tier 1

with fidelity, consistency and equity.

Tier 1 Action Planning Checklist - to list products schools need to develop.

MO SW PBS Tier 1 Artifacts Rubric - to help your team assess the quality of the materials your team develops.

Self-Assessment Survey - a research validated survey that measures perceptions of all staff on the status and priority for improvement of SW-PBS.

Tiered Fidelity Inventory - a research validated tool that measures the building leadership teams

perception of implementation fidelity of all three tiers.



Structure of the Implementation Guide Courses



The Tier 1, 2 and 3 Implementation Guides all have a similar structure. Each is organized into Courses to address the Essential Components for the tier of implementation (i.e., universal, targeted or intensive/ individualized). Each Course begins with lessons to implement the Essential Component with fidelity. Then for each lesson your team will find:

information about the lesson

an example and possible template for use

an activity for the team to complete to implement the lesson

a process to gain stakeholder engagement (when appropriate)

action planning prompts for activities to engage in to complete the lesson



Stakeholder Engagement and Communication

One of the most important systems the SW-PBS Leadership Team must consider is how to keep all staff, students, and families informed of the SW-PBS activities as they unfold. While much of the work will be done in conjunction with staff through regular staff meetings and professional learning activities, thoughtful updating and sharing with staff helps build and maintain “buy-in” and sustain their commitment to the work. Similarly, systems to keep families, the community, and of course students informed are essential, too.



Throughout your Tier 1 team’s work to establish and then sustain fidelity of implementation you will need to engage all stakeholders in- cluding teachers, staff, students, families and the community in each lesson of the work. First and foremost your team will need to establish systems to communicate. Creating a communication system must be intentional and strategic. There are three broad areas the SW- PBS Leadership Team will want to consider when developing a communi- cation system: 1) sharing ongoing information, 2) presenting data and,

3) obtaining feedback from stakeholders (staff, students, families and community).



Some ideas of communication strategies include:

Communication “tree”

Regular bulletins, newsletters

Posters

Parent letters

Presentation at Open House

Website

Monthly staff meetings

Bulletin board in the staff lounge (e.g., notices, general information, graphic data displays, etc.)

Suggestion box and surveys

Feedback/exit slips at the conclusion of meetings or pro- fessional learning activities

Requests of staff for draft revisions

Bulletin boards for students

Morning announcement/ update

Fair of student artwork or essays on SW-PBS

Overview presentations for community groups

SW-PBS overview in substi- tute packet and application paperwork

Social Media (e.g., TWITTER, FaceBook, Instagram, etc.)



In addition to the above creative communication ideas, teams will want to build time into team meetings to consider communication needs relative to agenda items just discussed. At the conclusion of your meetings, consider these questions: “What needs to be commu- nicated? How should it be communicated (formally or informally)? To whom do we need to share this? and, Who will be responsible for the communication?” This routine thoughtful planning for communication should lead to well-informed stakeholders and greater course.



For more information on creating a communication plan see Course 2

Leadership in this Tier 1 Implementation Guide.



Action Planning

From the lessons suggested in each Course, your leadership team will be able to develop a succinct action plan. Action Plans are useful be- cause they give you a framework for thinking about how you’ll com- plete a lesson, task or project efficiently. They help you ask yourselves, “did we do what we said we would do?” They help you finish activi- ties in a sensible order, and they ensure that you don’t miss any key lessons. Action plans differ from “To Do” lists in that they focus on the achievement of a single goal and gather together all of the careful planning for that goal. Action Plans make your work more intentional.



An action plan clearly organizes each task in a meaningful way to ensure plans get carried out. When you can see each task laid out, you can quickly decide which tasks to assign to whom. The headings on the Action Plan guide teams in making decisions about how to best accomplish their goals, and monitor to ensure on-going success. The template for action planning that you will find within all three MO SW-PBS Implementation Guides looks like the one on the next page.



As you can see, your team will be encouraged to consider each of the fol-

lowing as you plan for implementation with fidelity, consistency and equity:

End of Course Self-Assessments

At the end of each Course, self-assessments and/or checklists are included for your team to use to ensure that the efforts expended by the team or all staff/community members focus on critical indi- cators for implementation and sustainability. There are a number

of tools provided to help your team determine if you are ready to

implement and assess fidelity of implementation. These include:



The Tier 1 Action Planning Checklist

Teacher Tools that include self-assessment and practice

profiles (SAPPs)

MO SW-PBS Tier 1 Artifacts Rubric

The Self-Assessment Survey (SAS) (Sugai, Horner,& Todd, 2003)

The Tiered Fidelity Inventory (TFI) (Algozzine, Barnett, Eber, George, Horner, Lewis, Putnam, Swain-Bradway, McIntosh & Sugai, 2014)

Assessing Outcomes



The Tier 1 Action Planning Checklist

Within almost every lesson in this Tier 1 Implementation Guide, there will be one or more activities that your team will need to engage in to help you prepare to implement Tier 1 with fidelity, consistency and equity. Action steps may be as simple as, “assign team roles”, to as complex as, “engage all stakeholders in developing and refining your schoolwide matrix”. The action steps necessary to complete each Essential Component will be summarized at the end of each Course, and are collated into a single easy to refer to Tier 1 Action Planning Checklist.



Tier 1 Action Planning Checklist



The skills and products that are pivotal to MO SW-PBS are identified below and organized by the Es- sential Components. Used to guide team action planning, the specific content related to each of these skills or products will be gradually included in your training and technical assistance process. As such, it creates a roadmap of what should be in place to ensure a positive, proactive and instructional approach to social and behavioral skills.
